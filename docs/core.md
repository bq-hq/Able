At the heart of the Design System is our "Core" kit containing Primitives, Elements, Components and Collections of these. Elements and Components are the equivalent to Atoms and Molecules in the Atomic Design structure. Note, we've added our own lower level of "Base (Particles)" and other segmentations like "Primitives" and "Collections" to add much needed layers to the Atomic Design structure when speaking to the way we actually need to organize things in the design system.
