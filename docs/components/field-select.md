# Field - Selectlist

## Overview
Selectlists are like the DJ booths of form controls, giving users the power to pick their favorite option from a set of choices. It's like being at a party where you tap the select and suddenly a whole world of options opens up in front of you, like a menu at a fancy restaurant.

## Properties
Note: For each property, the **bolded** value indicates the default setting.
