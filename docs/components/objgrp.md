# ObjGroups

## Overview
Picture this: an object group is like a squad of Avatars, AdaptIcons, or Images partying together with a slight overlap, like they're in on a secret handshake. They stick together, but each still rocks their own unique style. It's like having a crew that's got your back but never forgets to bring their A-game.
