## Overview
The checkbox field is like the checkbox control’s best friend, pairing the checkbox with a label and helper text for extra clarity. It’s perfect for forms where you want to make sure users know exactly what they’re agreeing to (or opting out of).

## Properties
Note: For each property, the **bolded** value indicates the default setting.
