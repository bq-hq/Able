# Tag

## Overview
Tags are like the sidekicks that come in clutch, showing off icons and bite-sized info related to whatever they're covering. They're not just pretty faces - these bad boys can be moved around to suit the vibe, whether it's top left, top right, bottom left, or bottom right. Plus, they've got their own style game with options to tweak their size and color. It's like having a customizable cheerleader who's always ready to jazz up your content.
