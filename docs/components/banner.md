# Banner

## Overview
Banners are like the cooler, older sibling of tags - they give you a bit more breathing room to shine. Just like tags, they can strut their stuff in the top left, top right, bottom right, or bottom left corners, or take over the whole darn width of the stage. And here's the kicker - they can show off their semi-transparent style with icons and text, letting the underlying content peek through. It's like having a suave secret agent who knows how to steal the show with a touch of mystery and style.
