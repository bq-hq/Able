# Label

## Overview
Ah, the label component - the chameleon of the design world. It's like a stylist for your text, giving it that 'oomph' it needs to stand out. Need a splash of color? Boom, label! Want to make that text pop? Label's got your back. And guess what? It can even rock an icon alongside the text - total multitasker, I know, right? So, if you want your components to have that extra flair, just remember: labels are the ultimate fashion statement for text.
