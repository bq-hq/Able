# AdaptIcon

## Overview
Imagine your icons are like a fancy cocktail party - there's a new format called AdaptIcons where the background shapes are the stylish venue and the foreground icon is the life of the party. It's like having a two-layered fashion statement - the backdrop sets the mood and the icon steals the show. Trust me, it's like having a wardrobe full of mix-and-match outfits for your digital world.
