# Button Panel

## Overview
A button panel is like a squad of buttons ready to tackle tasks together, all united under a common cause. They're the dynamic team players of the user interface, each button offering a unique action that complements the group. Whether they're lined up horizontally or standing tall vertically, button panels bring a sense of order and unity to the screen.

Just like individual buttons, button panels can inherit all the cool properties of the button component - from styles to functionalities, they've got it all covered. It's like having a well-coordinated ensemble that knows how to work together harmoniously, making interactions smooth and seamless for users. So, think of button panels as the dream team that's always in sync and ready to make things happen with a click.
